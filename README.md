## Intro

Hello. Thanks for taking the time do our test. It's made up of two parts, a UI test and an API test. We have created blank projects with references for [NUnit](http://www.nunit.org) and [Selenium WebDriver](http://www.seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.jsp) using [NuGet](http://nuget.codeplex.com/) Packages. 

Feel free to use any other packages you think will help demonstrate your test writing skills.

## API Test

Using Google Tasks API https://developers.google.com/google-apps/tasks/ write tests for the following scenarios using C#, NUnit.  


1. Create a new task list and check the new task list is returned by GET tasklists.  
2. Create three tasks in the new task list and check the new tasks are returned by GET tasklist.  
3. Mark one task as completed and check if the task is returned by GET tasklist.  
4. Delete another task and check if the task is not returned by GET tasklist. 
5. Mark the last task as hidden and check if the task is not returned by GET tasklist.  
6. Call tasks.clear and check if no tasks are returned by GET tasklist.  
7. Call GET tasklists with showhidden = true and showdeleted = true and check that all tasks a returned.  
8. Delete the tasklist and check if it is not returned by GET tasklists.
